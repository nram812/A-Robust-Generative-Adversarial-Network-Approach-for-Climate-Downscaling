The configurations with the U-Net trained at the same time appear to preserve the climate change
signal better than those that are trained indepedently....

"""I think the the fourier layers could be a solution here


I need to figure out how to make them work though
"""

Something to note, about some "GAN regularization" and preserving the noise signal. The pretrained models appear to do overfit

I've now changed the decay rates to see if this improves the GanS.

Have now modified the discrimator to handle the maximum intensity and added a new constraint to make the model
more aware of the climate change signal .

Capturing the extreme eevents is important (i.e. the model is able to learn non-linear aspects of the dynamics....

Tried a few new things
1. I tried to introduce a spatial constraint (maximum) but that didn;t work well.
2. I tried to change the weight of the intensity constraint - which I haven't fully investigated yet
3. I tried to use a "fixed" pre-trained U-Net but that causes the model to even further overfit
4. I am now trying to now reduce the weight of the intensity constraint, but I have now changed the model
architecture to not have any concatenation of the unet at the last part (as I thought that was constraining the GAN too much).

I tried a signal preserving method during training, but it seems the biggest effect arises from the fact that I used batch normalization within
the layers of the network, bu

The GAN outputs for the extreme run are located on the paper/experiments folder.

Batchnormalization appears to play a really big role in the quality of the outputs, trained without batchnormalization appears to have lots of artifacts in the quality of the outputs
This is the case for both temperature and precipitatoin.

on 21-05 I moved the batch noramlization layers from the conv layer

I only just now aded a signal constraint
